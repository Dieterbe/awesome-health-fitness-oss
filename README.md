# Awesome Health And Fitness OSS Projects [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
Overviews of interesting health and fitness Free Software / Open Source projects
The goal here is *not* to be a complete list of every project in existince. Instead we have 3 lists:

* [awesome projects](#awesome-health--fitness-freeopen-source-projects)
* [interesting projects that didn't make it to the main list (yet)](#interesting-health--fitness-freeopen-source-projects)
* [suggested URL's where you can find more](#finding-more-health--fitness-freeopen-source-projects)

These lists are inevitably subjective, and it is impractical to have an in-depth review of each project.
In both lists, all projects have some notes about *why* I think it's interesting or awesome.
No hard feelings if your favorite project is not included.
Let me know via an issue or PR why you believe a project should be added / (re)moved. Thank you!
