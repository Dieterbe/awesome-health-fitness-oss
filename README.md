Overviews of interesting health and fitness Free Software / Open Source projects
The goal here is *not* to be a complete list of every project in existince. Instead we have 3 lists:
1) "awesome" projects.
2) "interesting" projects that didn't make it to the main list (yet).
3) suggested URL's where you can find more apps

These lists are inevitably subjective, and it is impractical to have an in-depth review of each project.
In both lists, all projects have some notes about *why* I think it's interesting or awesome.
No hard feelings if your favorite project is not included.
Let me know via an issue or PR why you believe a project should be added / (re)moved. Thank you!
